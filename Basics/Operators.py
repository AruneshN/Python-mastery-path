#1️⃣ Arithmetic Operators
'''Arithmetic Operators is perform mathamatic operation
| Operator | Meaning        | Example |
| -------- | -------------- | ------- |
| +        | Addition       | a + b   |
| -        | Subtraction    | a - b   |
| *        | Multiplication | a * b   |
| /        | Division       | a / b   |
| %        | Modulus        | a % b   |
| **       | Power          | a ** b  |
| //       | Floor Division | a // b  |

'''
# addition
a,b=10,25
print(a+b)

# Subtraction
print(a-b)

#multiplication
print(a*b)

#division
print(a/b)

#modulus
print(a%b) #Remainder = Dividend - (Divisor × Quotient)
            # Remainder = 10 -(25 x 0)
            #remainder =10 - 0
